=head2 new

  Arg [1]    : HashRef arguments for the constructor:
                - batch_size
                   - how many UniProt-KB records to accumulate in
                     the send buffer before pushing them to the
                     database. Defaults to 1 i.e. push every record
                     individually.
                - checkpoint_seconds
                   - how often, in seconds, to push the contents of
                     the send buffer to the database regardless of how
                     many entries it contains. Defaults to 0
                     i.e. disable this feature.
                - xref_dba
                   - DBAdaptor object passed from the xref pipeline
  Description: Constructor.
  Return type: Loader object
  Exceptions : none
  Caller     : UniProtParser::run()
  Status     : Stable

  Description: Wrap-up routine. At present, pushes to the database any
               data still residing in the send buffer.

  Description: Unconditionally push the contents of the send buffer to

               for internal use but could in principle be called
               explicitly as well.

=head2 load

  Arg [1]    : HashRef transformed_data UniProt-KB prepared by a
               transformer to be ready to be inserted into the database
  Description: Add transformed_data to the send buffer, then flush the
               buffer if either it has reached the specified size or
               the requested amount of time has passed since the last
               flush.

=head2 prepare_source_for_dependent_xrefs

  Arg [1]    : integer source_id Ensembl ID of the given xref source
  Description: A thin wrapper around
               BaseAdaptor::get_dependent_mappings(), which populates
               a $xref_dba-internal map with existing dependent_xref
               links in order to prevent insertion of duplicates in
               the event of a parser being re-run on the same input
               data. This method has been left to be called explicitly
               rather than being embedded in BaseAdaptor
               initialisation because generating such a map for all
               sources would likely be a costly operation in both
               memory and processing time.
  Return type: none
  Exceptions : none
